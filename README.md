# GBIF Bioclim R Toolkit
GBIF BioClim R Toolkit for Analyses of GBIF Species Distribution Data with Bioclimatic Rasters from WorldClim

GBIF Bioclim R Toolkit is an R script with a template to source species distribution data from the GBIF database as well as bioclimate variables and elevation from the WorldClim Dataset . The script then comprises several functions to facilitate extracting bioclimatic and elevation data from the WorldClim rasters, plotting geo-located species data on rasters, and plotting distributions of species bioclimatic variables based on different geographic ranges (e.g. lon/lat/elevation/grids) of the sampling.
